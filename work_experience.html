<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<h2>February 2017 - Human Resources Analyst at MITRE</h2>
<p>I began a job as a HR Analyst at <b>The MITRE Corporation</b> in February 2017. I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot of great new skills to help me in industry and had my first exposure to the corporate world.</p>

<h2>March 2018 - Introduction to WordPress at MITRE</h2>
<p>In March 2018 I was brought onto a project where I was quickly thrown into maintaining a WordPress site using the Divi Theme and also stewarding a Drupal website. Both sites very quickly turned into my favorite part of my job and I wanted to keep working with them. The great thing about both platforms is <i>coding was optional!</i> For a beginner, I thought they were both extremely managable to maintain. Through countless hours of working on sites, the WordPress SME and I became close friends and she was starting to pass along some projects. I loved working with her and started spending most of my time working on websites over anything else.</p>
