  <h1>Welcome to my Second HTML Practice Site!</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Hello, and welcome to my site! My name is Nicole Rothner and I'm currently a self taught front end developer working towards my Master's in Human&nbsp;Factors &amp; Applied&nbsp;Cognition at George Mason University. I work in a variety of platforms including WordPress (Divi Theme), SharePoint 2016, SharePoint 2019, SharePoint Online, Drupal, and occasionally HTML/CSS sites but everything I know has either been <em>self-taught</em> or <em>on the job training</em>.</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I'm from Chicago originally but spend most of my childhood in St. Maarten.</p>

  <p>My family moved to Delaware and that's where I attended high school and college. After college I received a job offer to work in Virginia and that's where I currently reside. Because my work exists entirely on the web, I have the ability to work on projects almost anywhere.

  I'd love to take the opportunity I have to work remote and spend some time traveling the United States and spending some time with family and friends that I wouldn't otherwise be able to.</p>
