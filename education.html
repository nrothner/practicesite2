<h1>Education</h1>
<h2>Undergraduate Degree</h2>
<p>In 2016 I graduated from the University of Delaware with a <i>Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with minors in Cognitive Science and Advertising.</i><br> 
I was known to change my major about every semester as I could not decide what career I wanted to pursue. If I was interested in a field, I would take an introductory course to get some exposure.</p>

	<li>Marketing</li>
	<li>Human Computer Interaction</li>

<p>My biggest strength and weakness is my desire to learn which led me down the winding path listed above. It wasn't until I took Human Computer Interaction my senior year that I was introduced to coding. In my HCI class, we used a program called <b>LiveCode</b> to develop applications which was my first exposure to the field I wanted to learn more about.</p>
<p>After graduation, I decided to spend my summer teaching myself how to code. Contrary to my plan, I received a job offer early the next year to work as an Analyst and I began my career in corporate. I accepted the offer with the caveat of knowing with hard work and dedication, I could be making a lateral move within the company towards web development.</p>

<h2>Graduate Degree (in progress)</h2>
<p>In Fall 2019 I began a Master's degree at George Mason University with the goal of working towards a career in UX Development. I'm about half way through my degree and really enjoying the experience so far. I've been able to build a lot of great skills, make lasting connections, and even be a part of the winning team for a competition called the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6587762659624570881-RfUo" target="_blank">Usabil-a-thon</a>.</p>
