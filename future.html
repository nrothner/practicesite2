	<h1>Future Plans</h1>
	<p>In the future, I plan to pursue a career in UX Development. I have a passion around UX as well as Web Developement. I can truly say I love learning.</p>
	<p>After graduate school, I hope to complete a certificate in web development to dive deeper into the field. I would like to build further upon my skills and be able to build a fully functional website using just HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Themeing. Currently, in my Web Authoring and Design course, I believe I will be able to acheive this goal by the end of summer session. Based on the syllabus, I think this will be an excellent course to test my knowledge and fill in the gaps.</p>
